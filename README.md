# library
An application designed to receive and store entries of books with their title, pages and author and whether or not they've been read, and display them in a user interface.

GOAL
Aim here is to develop an interactive page that will have check boxes or something similar for whether a book is read or not, so that when a person has finished the book they can mark it as read, and change the Book.read part in the array. Will need a form for entering new books that will then store the books in the array upon confirming, and a button to remove from the library if they're no longer in posession of the book.
